### Tool

- LESS:CSS

- use less;css to have all containers/boxes/dropdown work perfectly and align perfectly on the page
- use less;css to have the third page back ground color change depending on what the user picked as a color scheme
- use less;css to make the app look colorful and visually appealing (bubble letters, drawings, etc)
- use as I build each page
    - make each page more colorful and nicer than the other 



#### Beyond MVP
- Maybe try involving AI image genertaor where it could help them get a visual of the vent the app and them are panning (if possible)


- for the web links where users could shop, add "heres the closets target next to you" add try to go based off users "locataion"
- add a text box asking where they live (if thats the case)
